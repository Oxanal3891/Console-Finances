# Console Finances Task

I've been tasked with with creating code for analyzing the financial records of a company. 



## Features

The 'starter/index.js` file contains JavaScript code that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

* The total number of months included in the dataset.

* The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.

* The average of the changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period.
  
* The greatest increase in Profit/Losses (date and amount) over the entire period.

* The greatest decrease in Profit/Losses (date and amount) over the entire period.



## How to Deploy

To deploy this project run 'starter/index.html' file in your browser. Then right-click 'Inspect' and open the Console tab.
